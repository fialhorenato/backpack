# BackPack Algorithm Solution

You enter into a house with a X number of items with different values and wheights.

Your backpack can carry Y units of wheight measurement.

How do you will approach to get the best value?

I have 3 approach algorithms:

- Approach by profit (You choose always the most valuable, don't thinking about wheight) - Get the most valuables
- Approach by wheight (You choose always the less wheight, don't thinking about value) - Get more items
- Approach by density (You rank the items by density) - Get the best case scenario
